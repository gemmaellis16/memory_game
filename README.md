## **User Experience (UX)**


### **User Goals**

* The game should have information on how to play.
* The game should be easy to use on mobile, tablet and desktop.
* It should be visually appealing for children with the images and colours.
* The game should have sounds that are appealing to children such as an applause when completed to give positive feedback, sounds when the cards are turned.

 * A simple yet effective game that's eye catching for the children so that they want to play it time and time again. 


### **User Stories**

#### **As a player (aged 2-5years old) I want:**

 * To understand the main purpose of the game and be able to use the buttons correctly.

 * The buttons to be large enough to able to use and understand.

 * To hear sounds when the cards are chosen to let me know I have a pair. 

 * To be able to recognise the images that I'm clicking on as part of the farm.

 * To see a scoreboard so that I know if I've improved from the last game.

 * To hear positive audio feedback such as the applause when I have completed the game.


 #### **As a parent/carer of the child I want to:**

 * Be able to see the rules/information easily so that I can explain to the child how to play.

 * See that it's visually appealing and easy to navigate when helping my child.

 * To see the scoreboard to check if they've made progress.

 * To be able to turn the sound off if it becomes too repetitive.

### **Design**

#### * **Colour Scheme**

![Colour Scheme](assets/images/colors.png)

 * The colours that have been chosen are vibrant colours so there easy to see and stand out.
 The idea is that the colours are child friendly and colours that are associated with the farm.
    

#### * **Typography**

* The idea behind the font style is taken from many web sites and applications for children, such as Sesame Streetâ€™s web sites. The font is rounded and playful, so sans serif font is used for larger headlines and interactive UI elements, while using simpler, more traditional fonts for the more adult links at the bottom of the page. (https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/06effective-use-of-typography-in-applications-for-children-3.php)

#### * **Imagery**

* The background of a simple farm image was used in order to keep with the theme but not too busy to distract the user from the main game. 


[Back to top](#table-of-contents)


#### * **Styling**
Th cards have rounded corners as other memory cards that I have seen for children have corners like this - so it looks attractive for this age group. I also use all boxes like this because I think keeping the same rounded corner pattern throughout the page keeps consistency in design and maintains the feeling that all elements belong together.

#### * **Cards**

Farm animals were chosen for this game because they are recognised and loved by children, especially my children! We live in a farming community so this is a perfect choice for children in my area. It is inspired by the song "Old MacDonald" as lots of children recognise the song. 

#### * **Audio**

The sounds were chosen to reflect the sounds of farm animals that most children are familiar with. The card flipping sounds and when the the user has a correct match were added to give positive feedback and the applause has been used on completing the game as it lets them know that they have completed the game.

#### * **Testing User Stories from User Experience**

* **First Time Visitor Goals**

* As a user, I want to easily understand the game and to be kept interested.

    - When entering the site users will see a a pop up modal to write their name and choose their level.

    - On the main page, to the left of the screen the username and level will be shown then the to the right will be the page title and different buttons()

    - Upon scrolling the page the main card game will appear big and the center of the page. 

* As a user, I am curious to know more about the game

    - There will be a 'i' button to explain the rules.

    - There will also be a contact tool at the footer of the page.


* As a user, I want it to be simple and fun

 - Attractive colours, buttons and sounds.

 - Not too many colours and not too much content.

* As a user, I want appealing sounds

- For great audio feedback and to be kept interested.

- Sounds that are recognisable within a farm setting.


* As a user, I want the buttons to be child-friendly

 - Buttons should be large so they are easy to press.

As a user, I want the game to be simple so that it doesn't break

- Only two cards can be flipped at once

- It wont encouter problems if its clicked too fast

* **Returning Visitor Goals and Parents**

* As a user, I want to see the score.  

    - The score gives feedback to see if they can beat it.


* As a user, I want to see the contact info.

    - This will be at the foot of the page if they encouter any problems.

* As a user, I want to mute the game

    - This is in case the sounds gets too repetitive and irritating.

### * **Features**

 * Responsive on all device sizes.

 * Interactive elements.

### **Existing Features**

#### **Grid**

For the [grid](screenshots/navigation.png) I have used Boostrap. 

#### **Image**

The background [image](assets/css/images/yoga-main.jpg) is of a farm landscape to bring the farm landscape to the attention of the child.

#### **Pop up Modal**

The main idea to put a[pop up modal](screenshots/cover-text) and the beginning of the game was to grab the users attention immediately - by personilising it (through entering a name) and secondly to choose a level (easy, medium or hard) .

#### **Main Page**

The [Main Page](screenshots/) is based on a farm theme - as its simple and eye catching for the user and lots of children (2-5 years) have experience with learning about farm animals (especially in the rural area we live in). It is in two columns (taken from Bootstrap) to appear neat and tidy on the page with easily identifiable Font awesome icons to attract the user. 

#### **Buttons**

The [buttons](screenshots/) icons were used as they are widely known symbols so for kids its easy to identify them rather than reading any words - as they may not know how to read so symbols are easy to recognise. 
- "I" symbol for the rules and information on the game
- "Mute" button to turn the sound on/off as the user wishes.
- "Reset" button to start the game over.
- "Star" symbol for the scoreboard.
- "Time" symbol to keep the time of completed game.
- "Number" symbol to keep record of how many times cards were flipped over.

#### **Cards**

The cards were chosen becuase they were farm animals - and I chose similiar looking animals (front facing with big eyes) so that they kept with the theme and looked more attractive.

The number of cards were chosen (easy - 8) mainly because it was important to keep the number low as the user for this specific game is designed to be for 2-5 year olds. 
2 rows of 4 coloums on a desktop.
3 rows of 3/4 coloumn on mobile and desktop

The number of cards on the medium level (12) were chosen as its a gradual step up and would fit nicely on 3 rows of 4 coloumn on a desktop.

The number of cards on the hard level (16) were chosen agian for the gradual step up and would fit nicely on a 4x4 basis.


#### ****



#### ****

The [classes page](screenshots/classes.png) is the most simple page of them all - with  

#### **Contact**

At the bottom of the page I placed the [contact form](screenshots/) so that it would catch the attention of the users if they had any questions for the developer. They then have to enter their contact details. 

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### * **Features to be implemented**

* When submitting the form, the information should be sent to Dr Chick's game account.
* Chat bot that can assist the user.
* Interactive scoreboard.
* Include information on how their data will be used (GDPR-Law).


### * **Further Testing**

* The website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers.

* The game was viewed on a variety of devices such as desktop, laptop, tablet and iphone. 

* A large amount of testing was conducted to ensure that all buttons were working correctly.

* My toddler and some of my pupils in school were asked to play the game and asked to give feedback.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### * **[Navigation bar](screenshots/navbar-image.png)**

* **Idea**
I wanted to ensure that the navigation bar was working accordingly at the top of the page and when clicked on, the navigation links would take the user to the page of their choice. For simple and attractive purposes the navigation bar would then convert to a hamburger icon with a dropdown menu on mobile devices.

* **Utilization**
I implemented the navigation bar using Bootstrap, which ensured an effective overall structure and lay out to the navbar. CSS was used to overwrite the default settings and made the navbar in line with the overall webite. I also used Bootstrap to implement the hamburger sign for mobile devices.

* **Test**
To test the navigation bar, I clicked all the links to make sure it worked properly. I have also opened the website in various browers (safari, google chrome, mozilla firefox) to make sure it worked on all browsers and devices. On mobile the navigation transformed into the hamburger sign with a dropdown menu.

* **Result**
The navigation bar appears how I would have expected it on all browsers and devices. However on the index page (main page) while on mobile device the dropdown does not appear as it is as it's blurred by the text-cover box. - So I have to hide the cover box in mobile display in order to see the dropdown menu.

* **Verdict**
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.

### [Modal](screenshots/modal-image.png)
* **Idea**
I wanted to use a modal that would allow the user to book on the main page (a place were it's clearly visible and easy to get to for a returning user).

* **Utilisation**
I used Bootstrap to include the modals on the website and this was positioned to the left of the box as the text was also aligned left. I used the same colours as I did on my contact us form to keep consistency throughout the pages. 

* **Test**
Initially the modal worked succesfully however the next day it didn't work. So every effort was used to check the problem. I realised I had deleted a bootstrap link (because I had )

* **Result**
The modal opened up when the Book now button was clicked and appeared on screen.

* **Verdict**
The modal works as planned.

### [Audio](audio/relaxation.m4a)

* **Idea**
I wanted to use audio as a taster for users of what to expect when in the relaxation during a class. This would allow the user to determine if they would like to hear more by coming to a session.  

* **Utilisation**
I used an iphone recording device called 'voice memos' to record the audio and used one of the relaxation scripts I used during my classses in the past. To ensure they didn't miss this it was in the about section (to learn more about the classes) and I provided a clear download icon so that the user would know where to click.

* **Test**
The audio worked succesfully on the first test.

* **Result**
The audio opened up when the Download button was clicked and appeared on screen.

* **Verdict**
The audio works as planned.

### [Student Registration Form](downloads/student-form.pdf)

* **Idea**
I wanted to enable the users to download and fill in the student registration form (if they would prefer) before the session so there is no rush at the beginning of the session. This is important for the teacher to have as it gives the teacher an idea of any health issues so that the teacher would be able to adapt the sessions/poses for the individual. 

* **Utilisation**
I copied a student reg template I used in the past to a folder and again to keep it consistent with the audio link put a download icon next to it so that they could download the page. 

* **Test**
The file worked succesfully on the first test, 

* **Result**
The audio opened up when the Download button was clicked and appeared on screen.

* **Verdict**
The audio works as planned.

### [Contact Form](screenshots/form-input.png)

* **Idea**
I want to include a contact form so that the user can contact the studio/teacher with any queries they have (even to book through this too). On the form they can enter their name, email address and write a message. I also ensured they had to fill in the fields before submitting the button. 

* **Utilization**
To create this, I made a contact page and placed the form at the top of the page. There were two fields for the name and email address then a textarea field for the message and a submit button. I also ensured the form was the same colour as the rest of the pages for consistency.

* **Test**
When I tested the form, I realised that nothing opened up and there was nothing to indicate to the user that the form was submitted. This meant it was not user friendly, so if I had more experience I would have liked to include JS to implement this.

* **Result**
The form works but after filling it in all the content dissappears so the user is left if the message was sent.

* **Verdict**
The form worked but without feedback it is not user friendly.

### **Known Bugs**


* I had many issues on the mobile display trying to get the hamburger icon to sit on the right in the [navbar](screenshots/mobile-issue.png)so using float:right and position:absolute helped the issue.

### **Deployment** 

#### * **Git hub pages**

The project was deployed to Github pages using the following steps:

* Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/) and locate the GitHub Repository (gemmaellis16
/memory_game).
* In the navbar on the top right hand side press the "Settings" button.
* Locate [Pages](screenshots/gitpod-pages) on the left hand side of the page.
* Click "None on the source section and choose "Master Branch" on the source field and then choose "docs".
* Then deploy the page - you will have to wait 10 minutes for the page to deploy or when the blue writing turns green.

#### * **Forking Github Repository**

Forking means to make a copy of the original document so that you can view/edit without it altering the original repository. It can be forked using the following steps:

* Log into Github and locate the [Github Repository](https://github.com)
* Enter gemmaellis16/memory_game.
* At the top right of the navbar (above the profile icon), press the "Fork" button.
* This will enable you to get a copy of the original repository in your Github account.


#### * **Making a Clone**

Cloning means creating a local copy of the remote repository. This allows you to make edits locally rather than directly in the source files. It can be cloned using the following steps:

* Log into Github and find the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
* Locate the "Code" button and click "Clone or download".
* To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
* Open a terminal.
* Change the working directory to the area where you want the clone to be made to.
* Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied before.
* Press enter and create your local clone.
