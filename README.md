## **User Experience (UX)**

### **User Goals**

* The game should have information on how to play.
* The game should be easy to use on mobile, tablet and desktop.
* It should be visually appealing for children with the images and colours.
* The game should have sounds that are appealing to children such as an applause when completed to give positive feedback, sounds when the cards are turned.
* The sound button should be able to be turned on/off as they please.
* It should have three different levels from easy through to difficult easy(8 cards), medium(16 cards), difficult(20 cards)  
* It should have a name option so that they can see their score on th scoreboard.
* It should have a stop and reshuffle button option for the child. 
* It should have a timer so that that their time is recorded 

### **Owner Goals**

 * Clean programming so that the game cannot have problems when too many buttons are clicked at once.  
 * A simple yet effective game that's eye catching for the children so that they want to play it time and time again. 


### **User Stories**

#### **As a player aged between 2-5years old I want:**

 * To understand the main purpose of the game and be able to use the buttons correctly.

 * The buttons to be large enough to able to use and understand.

 * To hear sounds when the cards are chosen to let me know I have a pair. 

 * To be able to recognise the images that I'm clicking on as part of the farm.

 * To see a scoreboard so that I know if I've improved from the last game.

 * To hear positive audio feedback such as the applause when I have completed the game.


 #### **As a parent/carer of the child I want to:**

 * Be able to see the rules/information easily so that I can explain to the child how to play.

 * See that it's visually appealing and easy to navigate when helping my child.

 * To see the scoreboard to check if they've made progress.

 * To be able to turn the sound off if it becomes too distracting.
 
 * To know that it's safe for my child to use and that there are no links to anything that is not child friendly. 

 * Be able to contact the game developer if I have any questions.

### **Design**

#### * **Colour Scheme**

![Colour Scheme](asset.png)

 * The colours that have been chosen are vibrant colours so there easy to see and stand out.
 The idea is that the colours are child friendly and colours that are associated with the farm.
    

#### * **Typography**

* The idea behind the font style is taken from many web sites and applications for children, such as Sesame Streetâ€™s web sites. The font is rounded and playful, so sans serif font is used for larger headlines and interactive UI elements, while using simpler, more traditional fonts for the more adult links at the bottom of the page. (https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/06effective-use-of-typography-in-applications-for-children-3.php)

#### * **Imagery**

* The background of a simple farm image was used in order to keep with the theme but not too busy to distract the user from the main game. 


[Back to top](#table-of-contents)


#### * **Styling**
Th cards have rounded corners as other memory cards that I have seen for children have corners like this - so it looks attractive for this age group. I also use all boxes like this because I think keeping the same rounded corner pattern throughout the page keeps consistency in design and maintains the feeling that all elements belong together.

#### * **Cards**

Farm animals were chosen for this game because they are recognised and loved by children, especially my children! We live in a farming community so this is a perfect choice for children in my area. It is inspired by the song "Old MacDonald" as lots of children recognise the song. 

#### * **Audio**

The sounds were chosen to reflect the sounds of farm animals or toys that most children are familiar with. The card flipping sounds and "bing" on a correct match were added to give positive feedback for the children and the sound of applause has been used on completing the game as it appeals to most users in order to let them know that they have completed the game.


### * **Wireframes**

These are my wireframes that I initially made however I have edited my ideas during the coding process.

#### * **Testing User Stories from User Experience**

* **First Time Visitor Goals**

* As a user, I want to easily understand the game and to be kept interested.

    - When entering the site users will see a a pop up modal to write their name and choose their level.

    - On the main page, to the left of the screen the username and level will be shown then the to the right will be the page title and different buttons()

    - Upon scrolling the page the main card game will appear big and the center of the page. 

* As a user, I am curious to know more about the game

    - There will be a 'i' button to explain the rules.

    - There will also be a contact tool at the footer of the page.



* As a user, I want to know what yoga is and what are it's [benefits](screenshots/benefits.png).

* **Returning Visitor Goals**

* As a user, I want to find the best way to get into [contact](screenshots/contact.png) with the studio with any questions I may have. 

    - The navigation bar clearly highlights the 'Contact page'.

    - Here, they can fill out the form on the page (but I have not linked it to anything as this out of the scope of the MS1 project).

    - There is also the direct [phone number or email](screenshots/email.png) of the studio (fictional).

    - The [footer](screenshots/footer.png) contains links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram (to the main pages of the social media homepages and not to the teachers own account due to privacy purposes).

* As a user, I want to find out the [membership](screenshots/prices.png) options

    - In the classes page [prices](screenshots/prices.png) are clearly labelled for the visitor to view.

* As a user, I want to find out what days and times the [yoga](screenshots/timetable.png) sessions are on.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### * **Features**

 * Responsive on all device sizes.

 * Interactive elements.

### **Existing Features**

#### **Navigation**

For the [navigation bar](screenshots/navigation.png) I have used Boostrap to create a responsive navbar as well as the hamburger [icon](screenshots/navbar-image) for mobile devices to be more user-friendly. 

#### **Main Image**

The main [image](assets/css/images/yoga-main.jpg) is of a yoga pose on the beach during sunset from the website unsplash. It creates a warm, calming feeling. The yoga pose is a simple pose that all abilities can perfrom so wouldn't put off any beginners or unconfident students.

#### **Cover Text**

The main idea to put [cover text](screenshots/cover-text) over the image was to grab the users attention immediately - one box is to get them to book a session straight away or to have that in their minds immediately and the second box is to explain the definition of yoga so that a beginner understands the purpose.

#### **Benefits**

The [Benefits](screenshots/benefits.png) idea was taken from the Love Running project - as its simple and eye catching for the user - with short explanations of what the benefits of yoga are to a beginner or even to remind the experienced yoga students. It is in three columns (taken from Bootstrap) to appear neat and tidy on the page with easily identifiable Font awesome icons to attract the user. 

#### **Testimonials**

The [testimonials](screenshots/testimonials.png) section also used the grid from bootstrap and some icons to make the section more visually appealing with images from my own collection and different names for the people in the images (I have consent of these people).

#### **About Section**

I used an example layout from W3 website to create the [about](screenshots/about.png) section to introduce the user to the teacher. With the same image layout that was used in the testimonials section for consistency over the pages.

I added an [information/etiquette/tips](screenshots/info.png) section because as a new student to yoga they may feel uncomfortable entering a studio without any prior knowledeg of what to bring and of what to expect ect so this may help those that are unconfident accessing the studio alone. 

In addition I added two downloadable links on this page, one of a sample relaxation script which had [audio](screenshots/audio-image.png) and the second of a student registration [form](screenshots/student-form.png) that would be required upon visiting the studio for the first time. Again I added fontawesome icons to the headers to be more appealing.

#### **Gallery**

I wanted three columns and three rows of images in the [gallery](screenshots/gallery-mobile.png) so it would be appealing to the eye on desktop view and then down to two columns in mobile view so that images didn't appear stretched or pixlated. I did originally put in the wireframes that I wanted one column in the mobile view but this wouldn't appear balanced in my opinion. So there are 12 images which appear balanced in the gallery(balance is at the heart of yoga so I wanted the website to appear balanced as much as possible throughout).

#### **Classes**

The [classes page](screenshots/classes.png) is the most simple page of them all - with three simple tables to look at the class timetable, simple descriptions of the classes and then the price options. It is important to have different price options as this may attract more students. Originally in the wireframes I had placed the coloumns side by side but felt it was more appealing one underneath the other as the text took a lot of room on the page. 

#### **Contact**

At the top of the page I placed the [form](screenshots/form-input.png) so that it would catch the attention of the users if they had any questions for the teacher. They then have to scroll down for the contact details and the [map](screenshots/map-contact.png) of the location. 

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### * **Features to be implemented**

* When submitting the form, the information should be sent to the yoga studio email account.
* Chat bot that can assist the user.
* Interactive map for the location with a link to google maps.
* Include information on how their data will be used (GDPR-Law).
* Yoga videos for those that can not attend class.  
* One scrollable page with all the information on one page to make it user friendly.


### * **Further Testing**

* The website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers.

* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as desktop, laptop, tablet and iphone. 

* A large amount of testing was conducted to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

* Friends were asked to review the site and content to point out any bugs/user experience.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### * **[Navigation bar](screenshots/navbar-image.png)**

* **Idea**
I wanted to ensure that the navigation bar was working accordingly at the top of the page and when clicked on, the navigation links would take the user to the page of their choice. For simple and attractive purposes the navigation bar would then convert to a hamburger icon with a dropdown menu on mobile devices.

* **Utilization**
I implemented the navigation bar using Bootstrap, which ensured an effective overall structure and lay out to the navbar. CSS was used to overwrite the default settings and made the navbar in line with the overall webite. I also used Bootstrap to implement the hamburger sign for mobile devices.

* **Test**
To test the navigation bar, I clicked all the links to make sure it worked properly. I have also opened the website in various browers (safari, google chrome, mozilla firefox) to make sure it worked on all browsers and devices. On mobile the navigation transformed into the hamburger sign with a dropdown menu.

* **Result**
The navigation bar appears how I would have expected it on all browsers and devices. However on the index page (main page) while on mobile device the dropdown does not appear as it is as it's blurred by the text-cover box. - So I have to hide the cover box in mobile display in order to see the dropdown menu.

* **Verdict**
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.

### [Modal](screenshots/modal-image.png)
* **Idea**
I wanted to use a modal that would allow the user to book on the main page (a place were it's clearly visible and easy to get to for a returning user).

* **Utilisation**
I used Bootstrap to include the modals on the website and this was positioned to the left of the box as the text was also aligned left. I used the same colours as I did on my contact us form to keep consistency throughout the pages. 

* **Test**
Initially the modal worked succesfully however the next day it didn't work. So every effort was used to check the problem. I realised I had deleted a bootstrap link (because I had )

* **Result**
The modal opened up when the Book now button was clicked and appeared on screen.

* **Verdict**
The modal works as planned.

### [Audio](audio/relaxation.m4a)

* **Idea**
I wanted to use audio as a taster for users of what to expect when in the relaxation during a class. This would allow the user to determine if they would like to hear more by coming to a session.  

* **Utilisation**
I used an iphone recording device called 'voice memos' to record the audio and used one of the relaxation scripts I used during my classses in the past. To ensure they didn't miss this it was in the about section (to learn more about the classes) and I provided a clear download icon so that the user would know where to click.

* **Test**
The audio worked succesfully on the first test.

* **Result**
The audio opened up when the Download button was clicked and appeared on screen.

* **Verdict**
The audio works as planned.

### [Student Registration Form](downloads/student-form.pdf)

* **Idea**
I wanted to enable the users to download and fill in the student registration form (if they would prefer) before the session so there is no rush at the beginning of the session. This is important for the teacher to have as it gives the teacher an idea of any health issues so that the teacher would be able to adapt the sessions/poses for the individual. 

* **Utilisation**
I copied a student reg template I used in the past to a folder and again to keep it consistent with the audio link put a download icon next to it so that they could download the page. 

* **Test**
The file worked succesfully on the first test, 

* **Result**
The audio opened up when the Download button was clicked and appeared on screen.

* **Verdict**
The audio works as planned.

### [Contact Form](screenshots/form-input.png)

* **Idea**
I want to include a contact form so that the user can contact the studio/teacher with any queries they have (even to book through this too). On the form they can enter their name, email address and write a message. I also ensured they had to fill in the fields before submitting the button. 

* **Utilization**
To create this, I made a contact page and placed the form at the top of the page. There were two fields for the name and email address then a textarea field for the message and a submit button. I also ensured the form was the same colour as the rest of the pages for consistency.

* **Test**
When I tested the form, I realised that nothing opened up and there was nothing to indicate to the user that the form was submitted. This meant it was not user friendly, so if I had more experience I would have liked to include JS to implement this.

* **Result**
The form works but after filling it in all the content dissappears so the user is left if the message was sent.

* **Verdict**
The form worked but without feedback it is not user friendly.

### **Known Bugs**


* I had many issues on the mobile display trying to get the hamburger icon to sit on the right in the [navbar](screenshots/mobile-issue.png)so using float:right and position:absolute helped the issue.

### **Deployment** 

#### * **Git hub pages**

The project was deployed to Github pages using the following steps:

* Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/) and locate the GitHub Repository (gemmaellis16
/memory_game).
* In the navbar on the top right hand side press the "Settings" button.
* Locate [Pages](screenshots/gitpod-pages) on the left hand side of the page.
* Click "None on the source section and choose "Master Branch" on the source field and then choose "docs".
* Then deploy the page - you will have to wait 10 minutes for the page to deploy or when the blue writing turns green.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### * **Forking Github Repository**

Forking means to make a copy of the original document so that you can view/edit without it altering the original repository. It can be forked using the following steps:

* Log into Github and locate the [Github Repository](https://github.com)
* Enter gemmaellis16/memory_game.
* At the top right of the navbar (above the profile icon), press the "Fork" button.
* This will enable you to get a copy of the original repository in your Github account.


#### * **Making a Clone**

Cloning means creating a local copy of the remote repository. This allows you to make edits locally rather than directly in the source files. It can be cloned using the following steps:

* Log into Github and find the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
* Locate the "Code" button and click "Clone or download".
* To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
* Open a terminal.
* Change the working directory to the area where you want the clone to be made to.
* Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied before.
* Press enter and create your local clone.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### **Content**

* Content was written by the developer - and inspired by books and toys that my toddler owns.

### **Media** 

* All gallery images created by the developer - they are photos from a yoga studio I attended as part of my yoga teacher training in Spain. So the studio does not exist in North Wales (like I have stated but merely a fictional studio in Betws y Coed). The testimonial images have also been created by me. 

* But as noted previously the main image is sourced from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/UvWx67Ivqe0).
* The map on the contact page was sourced from [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Betws-y-Coed/@53.0910704,-3.8119933,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48651463227a6575:0x2afbefd48524751d!8m2!3d53.0930858!4d-3.8010354?hl=en)


### **Aknowledgments** 

* Tutors at Code Institute for their support.
* My mentor for being so down to earth, with briliant advice and support on the project.
